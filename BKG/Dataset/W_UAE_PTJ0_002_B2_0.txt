A job makes the person more responsible of his/her life. Nowadays, teenagers are really reckless because they receive whatever they want in the easiest way ever. Part time jobs are the only way that will make teenagers be aware of the money they are wasting. I my opinion, part time job is the answer to all the careless teenagers. The only way a person will know the value of the things he/she buys and be more careful with the money they have is to work for it. For example, if the parents never say no to their children and always give them the full amount of money they want, the children will waste as much as they want and they would not care about anything. On the other hand, parents who always make their children be responsible of the money they are wasting and let the work for it are living a better life. These children grow mature way much faster because they are aware of how hard they're earning the money. It wont be easy for them to buy things they do not need and want. These children are more successful and more responsible of their actions. Each person lives the teenage life, but not all of them lived in a right way or bad way. Everyone has its own way; he/she chooses his/her own path.
